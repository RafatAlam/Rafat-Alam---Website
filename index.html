        <div class="subheading mb-5">Computer Science ðŸ’»</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Rafat Alam and I grew up in Fullerton, CA. I have lived around the same place for all of my life but now I am living in Riverside, CA as I am enrolled as a first year at UCR. I am currently an undeclared major but am hoping to change my major to computer science. Some of my hobbies include playing video games, weight lifting, modding cars, and reading manga.<br><br>

        One of the reasons I am choosing computer science as my major is because ever since I was little I was always on the computer, whether it was playing games or watching videos. I always felt comfortable around computers and enjoy making custom PCs. I know that computer science is a hard subject but I am willing to put in the work for my four years in college in order to have a job that I enjoy. In order to achieve this I plan on getting an internship and building my portfolio before I finish college, so that once I am done it would be easier for me to get a job. I only learned about how to create HTML coding so it might be difficult for me to adjust to other coding programs, which is why I am planning on taking coding boot camps and learning on the internet on my own time. Another thing that I am interested in doing is minoring in business as I already have many of the credits required for it.<br><br>

        Some past experiences which would help me achieve my goal would be my work experience and the classes I took in highschool. During my time working at Rubio's Coastal Grill as a general service assistant I learned many things about the customer service and fast food industry. Some of the things I learned was how to work as a team with the other employees and how to manage time dealing with customers and bagging food. I also learned how hard people in the fast food industry have it because there are many customers who don't treat the people working like actual people. These things I learned in the fast food industry can translae well when I get my first job because I know how to work with others as a team. I know how to ask for help and when to help others so that we can work efficiently covering each others weaknesses. I also learned how to manage time efficiently between different tasks which would help when I need to work on multiple projects with upcoming deadlines. Lastly, I would be able to keep a cool mind when things don't go well because I have experience dealing with tricky customers. Some classes I took in high school which would help me achieve my goal of getting my CS degree with a minor in business would be an intro to coding class and a business finance class. These two classes would help me with some basic knowledge so I have some idea of what I'm doing when I take higher level classes. All of these factors would help me achieve my goals.
